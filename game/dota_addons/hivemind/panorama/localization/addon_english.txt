	"gameinfo_main_intro"							"In Hivemind, every hero's first ability can be used to enter \"split form,\" transforming into a group of 4-5 units with their own set of abilities. You can return to hero form by using the first ability on any split unit."

	"gameinfo_main_tip1"							"1. You are invulnerable for a moment while transforming. Use that to dodge enemy spells and attacks!"
	"gameinfo_main_tip2"							"2. Cooldowns, buffs, and debuffs tick down on your hero even while in split form, and vice versa. Toggle between forms often to use your cooldowns efficiently and avoid problematic debuffs."
	"gameinfo_main_tip3"							"3. While splitting, you can cast the ability again before your transformation completes to space your units out more. Try this if you're getting shredded by AOE spells, but be careful not to get caught in the trees!"
	"gameinfo_main_good_luck"						"Good luck!"
